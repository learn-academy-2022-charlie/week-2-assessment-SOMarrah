# ASSESSMENT 2: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?

  Your answer: A parameter is the logic used to identify what will be passed into a function or method. The parameter is used to tell the developer what kind of information is expected. The argument is the actual data being used.

  Researched answer: The technical definition is an argument is initialized into the parameter defined. There are input and output parameters. If a parameter that has been initialized was left undefined that is was it will return by default. You can then target the undefined value for a catch-all if needed.



2. The JavaScript built in method .map() takes predefined parameters. What are they? Which are required and which are optional?

  Your answer: The three predefined parameters that the .map() method takes are value, index, and array. Only value is required, and the other two are optional.

  Researched answer: There is a fourth optional parameter for map called thisValue, it is used for a this value inside of the function.



3. What is the difference between map and filter?

  Your answer: The difference between the map and filter built in methods are that map iterates through each element in an array and returns a new array. Filter iterates through each element in an array using a conditional and returns a new array that is shorter.

  Researched answer: Filter returns a subset of the given array, meaning it is not a new array.  Map does something to each element in an array while filter makes a decision based on each element inside of the array.



4. What is the difference between a function and a method?

  Your answer: The difference between function and method are that methods are nested inside of other functions, objects or classes. It may be that methods have to be nested inside of other code specifically.

  Researched answer: A method is an object property with a function value. A function is code that can be invoked to do a particular task.



5. What is object destructuring?

  Your answer: I think that object destructuring refers to accessing the information inside of an object and transforming specific things inside of it. Either the key, the values, or the order they are in inside of the object.

  Researched answer: Destructuring is used to create a new variable like a short cut to access information inside of objects. To destructure you need create a new variable with the keywords you want access to in curly bracers and then assign it to the path where it is located.



6. STRETCH: What is hoisting in JavaScript?

  Your answer: To me hoisting is like bringing something up - in JavaScript hoisting could be passing information from a child to a parent class.

  Researched answer: Hoisting is when all declared variables are "pulled" to the top to be read first, before everything else. This is useful because you can use variables and declare them later and the code will still run because JavaScript hoisted those variables to be read first. Technically the variables are declared at the top of the current scope.



## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Class Inheritance: Classes inherit information from a parent class. Much like parents pass genetic information to their children. This is useful because you only need to type code once and it can be used without repeating yourself (DRY)

2. React: React is a javascript library created by meta. It is used for webpages and is component based.

3. React state: a component that manages data and behavior.

4. React lifecycle methods: React lifecycle has three phases: mounting, updating, and unmounting. There are methods in react that can access and change data and behavior depending on what phase you are in, what phase is being used, and when a phase is initialized.

5. DOM: stands for Document Object Model. It is an interface for web documents. Basically it is what loads on the screen that we can see and interact with.
